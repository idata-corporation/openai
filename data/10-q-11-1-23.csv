"INTRODUCTION"
"Freddie Mac is a GSE chartered by Congress in 1970, with a mission to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability to the U.S. housing market. We do this primarily by"
"purchasing single-family and multifamily residential mortgage loans originated by lenders. In most instances, we package these loans into guaranteed mortgage-related"
"securities, which are sold in the global capital markets, and transfer interest-rate and liquidity risks to third-party investors. In addition, we transfer mortgage credit risk"
"exposure to third-party investors through our credit risk transfer programs, which include securities- and insurance-based offerings. We also invest in mortgage loans"
"and mortgage-related securities. We do not originate mortgage loans or lend money directly to mortgage borrowers."
"We support the U.S. housing market and the overall economy by enabling America's families to access mortgage loan funding with better terms and by providing"
"consistent liquidity to the single-family and multifamily mortgage markets. We have helped many distressed borrowers keep their homes or avoid foreclosure and have"
"helped many distressed renters avoid eviction."
"Since September 2008, we have been operating in conservatorship, with FHFA as our Conservator. The conservatorship and related matters significantly affect our"
"management, business activities, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future is uncertain, and the conservatorship has no specified termination date. We do"
"not know what changes may occur to our business model during or following conservatorship, including whether we will continue to exist. In connection with our entry"
"into conservatorship, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Treasury, under which we issued Treasury both senior preferred stock and a warrant to purchase"
"common stock. Our Purchase Agreement with Treasury is critical to keeping us solvent and avoiding the appointment of a receiver by FHFA under statutory mandatory"
"receivership provisions. We believe the support provided by Treasury pursuant to the Purchase Agreement currently enables us to have adequate liquidity to conduct"
"normal business activities. For additional information on the conservatorship and related matters and the Purchase Agreement, see our 2022 Annual Report."

"Market Risk"
"Overview"
"Our business segments have embedded exposure to market risk, which is the economic risk associated with adverse changes in interest rates, volatility, and spreads."
"Market risk can adversely affect future cash flows, or economic value, as well as earnings and net worth. The primary sources of interest-rate risk are our investments in"
"mortgage-related assets, the debt we issue to fund these assets, and our Single-Family guarantees."
""
"Interest-Rate Risk"
""
"Our primary interest-rate risk measures are duration gap and Portfolio Value Sensitivity (PVS). Duration gap measures the difference in price sensitivity to interest rate"
"changes between our financial assets and liabilities and is expressed in months relative to the value of assets. PVS is an estimate of the change in the present value of"
"the cash flows of our financial assets and liabilities from an instantaneous shock to interest rates, assuming spreads are held constant and no rebalancing actions are"
"undertaken. PVS is measured in two ways, one measuring the estimated sensitivity of our portfolio value to a 50 basis point parallel movement in interest rates (PVS-L)"
"and the other to a non-parallel movement resulting from a 25 basis point change in the slope of the yield curve (PVS-YC). While we believe that duration gap and PVS"
"are useful risk management tools, they should be understood as estimates rather than as precise measurements."

"Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements"
"NOTE 1"
"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"
"Freddie Mac is a GSE chartered by Congress in 1970, with a mission to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability to the U.S. housing market. We are regulated by"
"FHFA, the SEC, HUD, and Treasury, and are currently operating under the conservatorship of FHFA. The conservatorship and related matters significantly affect our"
"management, business activities, financial condition, and results of operations. In connection with our entry into conservatorship, we entered into the Purchase"
"Agreement with Treasury, under which we issued Treasury both senior preferred stock and a warrant to purchase common stock. Our Purchase Agreement with"
"Treasury is critical to keeping us solvent and avoiding the appointment of a receiver by FHFA under statutory mandatory receivership provisions. We believe the support"
"provided by Treasury pursuant to the Purchase Agreement currently enables us to have adequate liquidity to conduct normal business activities. For more information on"
"the conservatorship, the roles of FHFA and Treasury, and the Purchase Agreement, see our 2022 Annual Report. Throughout our unaudited condensed consolidated"
"financial statements and related notes, we use certain acronyms and terms which are defined in the Glossary of our 2022 Annual Report."
"The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related"
"notes in our 2022 Annual Report."
""
"Basis of Presentation"
"The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include our accounts as well as the"
"accounts of other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated."
"We are operating under the basis that we will realize assets and satisfy liabilities in the normal course of business as a going concern and in accordance with the"
"authority provided by FHFA to our Board of Directors to oversee management's conduct of our business operations. In the opinion of management, our unaudited"
"condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of our results."
""
"Use of Estimates"
"The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of"
"assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Management has made"
"significant estimates to report the allowance for credit losses on single-family mortgage loans. Actual results could be different from these estimates."

"The following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of the assets and liabilities recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets that relate to"
"our variable interests in VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary and with which we were involved in the design and creation and have a significant continuing"
"involvement, our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with such VIEs, and the total assets of the VIEs. Our involvement with such VIEs primarily"
"consists of guarantees that we have issued to the VIE, some of which are accounted for as derivative instruments, and investments in debt securities issued by the VIE."
"See Note 4 for additional information on our guarantees to nonconsolidated VIEs."
"Total assets shown in the table below represents the remaining UPB of the mortgage loans or other noncash financial assets held by the VIE and excludes cash and"
"nonfinancial assets held by the VIE. Maximum exposure to loss shown in the table below is primarily based on the remaining UPB of the guaranteed securities issued by"
"the VIE and represents the contractual amounts that could be lost if the assets of the VIE (including the assets in the related reference pool for CRT products) became"
"worthless at the balance sheet date, without consideration of proceeds from related collateral liquidation and possible recoveries under credit enhancements. We do not"
"believe the maximum exposure to loss from our involvement with nonconsolidated VIEs is representative of the actual loss we are likely to incur based on our historical"
"loss experience and after consideration of proceeds from related collateral liquidation and available credit enhancements."

"Legal Contingencies"
"We are involved, directly or indirectly, in a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business (including, among other"
"things, contractual disputes, personal injury claims, employment-related litigation, and other legal proceedings incidental to our business) and in connection with the"
"conservatorship and Purchase Agreement. We are frequently involved, directly or indirectly, in litigation involving mortgage foreclosures. From time to time, we are also"
"involved in proceedings arising from our termination of a seller's or servicer's eligibility to sell loans to, and/or service loans for, us. In these cases, the former seller or"
"servicer sometimes seeks damages against us for wrongful termination under a variety of legal theories. In addition, we are sometimes sued in connection with the"
"origination or servicing of loans. These suits typically involve claims alleging wrongful actions of sellers and servicers. Our contracts with our sellers and servicers"
"generally provide for indemnification of Freddie Mac against liability arising from sellers' and servicers' wrongful actions with respect to loans sold to or serviced for"
"Freddie Mac."
"Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertainties (including appeals and procedural filings), and there can be no assurance as to the"
"ultimate outcome of those actions (including the matters described below). In accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies, we reserve for litigation claims"
"and assessments asserted or threatened against us when a loss is probable (as defined in such guidance) and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The"
"actual costs of resolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those actions."
"It is not possible for us to predict the actions the U.S. government (including Treasury and FHFA) might take in response to any ruling or finding in any of these lawsuits"
"or any future lawsuits. However, it is possible that we could be adversely affected by these events, including, for example, by changes to the Purchase Agreement, or"
"any resulting actual or perceived changes in the level of U.S. government support for our business."

"District of Ohio purportedly on behalf of a class of purchasers of Freddie Mac stock from August 1, 2006 through November 20, 2007. FHFA later intervened as"

"the mortgage industry. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and interest, and reasonable costs and expenses, including attorney and expert fees."

"covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duties, and violation of Delaware and Virginia corporate law. Additionally, the Class Plaintiffs brought"
"derivative claims against FHFA for breach of fiduciary duties and the Individual Plaintiffs brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. Both sets of claims are"
"generally based on allegations that the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock that were implemented pursuant to the August 2012"
"amendments nullified certain of the shareholders’ rights, including the rights to receive dividends and a liquidation preference. On September 28, 2018, the District Court"
"dismissed all of the claims except those for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The cases were consolidated for trial."

"Over the last several years, numerous lawsuits have been filed against the U.S. government and, in some cases, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of"
"FHFA, challenging certain government actions related to the conservatorship (including actions taken in connection with the imposition of conservatorship) and the"
"Purchase Agreement. Freddie Mac is not a party to all of these lawsuits. Several of the lawsuits seek to invalidate the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior"
"preferred stock, which were implemented pursuant to the August 2012 amendment to the Purchase Agreement. Some of these cases also have challenged the"
"constitutionality of the structure of FHFA. A number of cases have been dismissed (some of which have been appealed), and others remain pending."
"These cases include one that was filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims as a derivative lawsuit, purportedly on behalf of Freddie Mac as a “nominal” defendant: Reid"
"and Fisher vs. the United States of America and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. This case was filed on February 26, 2014. The complaint alleges, among"
"other items, that the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock constitute an unlawful taking of private property for public use without just"
"compensation. The plaintiffs ask that Freddie Mac be awarded just compensation for the U.S. government's alleged taking of its property, attorneys' fees, costs, and"
"other expenses. The Court dismissed the case with prejudice on September 1, 2023 and entered judgment for the defendants."
"Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, in addition to satisfying other conditions, all currently pending material litigation related to our conservatorship and/or the Purchase"
"Agreement must be resolved or settled and we must indemnify Treasury and the United States from and against any loss, cost, or damage of any kind arising out of our"

"we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms and that"
